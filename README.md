# Altimeter
Simple pressure altimeter for Android

This app uses the built-in pressure meter on your Android device and computes your altitude.

This is a "sensitive altimeter" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter#Use_in_aircraft) which means that you
calibrate it by entering the nominal sea level pressure. In aviation use, the sea level pressure is normally
obtained via radio information broadcasts (ATIS) which provide the altimeter setting for the local airport.
